"""Extract the common logic of displaying the correct and wrong answers into a separate function. This will make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

Use a while loop instead of a for loop and a recursive function call to keep the program running until the user wants to exit.

The use of the os.system("clear") function is not portable across different operating systems. You can use the subprocess library to call the appropriate command for different operating systems.

Instead of using time.sleep() to pause the program, use the built-in input function with a prompt to pause the program until the user is ready to continue.

It would be good to add some comments in the code to explain the purpose of each function and the process flow of the program.

Use a dictionary data structure to store the English and Slovak words in pairs, it will make it easier to match the answers and keep track of the score.

You can also add some functionalities like keeping a score, displaying the score at the end, and giving the option to repeat the words that were answered incorrectly.

Use a single list for both English and Slovak words and store them in tuple format."""
